These are the latest projects I have worked on this semester, and they are divided into two parts:

- Software Engineering: larger-scale software projects, usually pair-programmed.
    - final project: What's in my fridge: www.whatsinmyfridgeco.com --> a personalized website that suggests recipes for you based on user ingredients.

- Computer Vision: implementations of one or more vision algorithms/ideas
    - final project: Video Style Transfer --> style any video or image as your favorite painting!

*Much of this is from earlier in the semester.

*None of this code will run as I took out the data files required to run them.
