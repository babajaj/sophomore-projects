These are the latest projects I have worked on this semester, and they are divided into two parts:

- software engineering: pair-programmed larger-scale software projects.

- computer vision: implementations of one or more vision algorithms/ideas within a given stencil code.

*Much of this is from earlier in the semester, and I am currently working on a final projects in each course which are completely independent and much more sophisticated than these, as I continue to learn good software engineering practices and computer vision techniques.

*None of this code will run as I took out the data files required to run them.
